# Active Directory Security: Deployment, Monitoring with Splunk, and Attack Simulation

* This project focuses on building and securing an Active Directory environment. It involves setting up virtual machines, configuring Sysmon and Splunk for monitoring, and installing Active Directory. Additionally, the project includes testing security using brute-force attacks from Kali Linux, analyzing telemetry data in Splunk, and conducting atomic tests with ART.
